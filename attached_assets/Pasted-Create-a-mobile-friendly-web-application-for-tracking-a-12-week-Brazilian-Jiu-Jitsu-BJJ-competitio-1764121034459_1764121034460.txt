Create a mobile-friendly web application for tracking a 12-week Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) competition camp. The app should let fighters:

Set up a profile (name, weight, height, martial art, competition date)

View their daily training and nutrition tasks based on the program schedule

Check off each completed item (training, nutrition, recovery)

Enter a daily journal describing their performance, challenges, and notes for their coach

See weekly progress and session completion rates; log weight

Easily send a formatted check-in summary to their coach (via copy/export/email)

Reference full program details any time (phases, exercise guides, nutrition, recovery)

Core Features:

Profile Management: Editable profile (localStorage persistence)

Dynamic Daily Dashboard: Week/day calculation, automatic schedule display (S&C, BJJ, conditioning, nutrition)

Checklists: For training, exercises, and all nutrition components

Journal Entry: Daily textarea log, last 7 days reference, “Save” button

Weekly Overview: Calendar with completion indicators

Progress Tracking: Stats page showing completion %, weight chart, session stats

Coach Communication: “Send Update to Coach” button compiles stats/journal for export/copy/email

Program Reference: View full standardized camp program anytime—phases, lifts, RPE table, nutrition, auto-regulation guidelines

Mobile-first UI: Responsive, with modern athletic design and dark/light mode toggle

Implementation Notes:

Use vanilla JS or TypeScript (or React) with localStorage for all persistence

All schedule and progression logic hard-coded (standardized lifts every session, sets/reps/RPE vary by week)

All UI elements must work smoothly on a phone

Feature visual status icons: completed (green), incomplete (gray), rest day (blue)

Export function outputs copyable plain text for coaches

Design System:

Primary color: teal (for active/completed items)

Professional, clean athletic theme (white/charcoal backgrounds, accent colors)

Form validation on setup

Animations for check-ins/check-offs

User Story:

Athlete sets up profile and program start/competition dates

Each day, sees their tailored training & nutrition checklist for that day/week

Checks off what’s completed, writes a journal entry

Can send a weekly summary to coach at any time

Reviews their progress and stats over time
